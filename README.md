# Reconnaissance-Faciale
This code provides an interactive facial recognition solution, useful for attendance management and other similar applications. Make sure to install the required libraries and customize the code according to your specific needs. This Python script uses various libraries such as OpenCV, face_recognition and gTTS to achieve facial recognition and attendance management. It starts by capturing an image from a webcam or Raspberry Pi camera, then loads a series of previously saved images into the 'ImagesAttendance' directory. These images serve as references for facial recognition. Then it encodes the faces in these reference images
# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* face_recognition
* gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
* playsound
* picamera (dans le cas ou on travail avec raspberry camera)
  
# Resultats
